# Udacity NanoDegree Data Structures &amp; Algorithms projects

Advanced course on Data Structures & Algorithms with hands-on practice:
• Searching and sorting algorithms on different data structures
• Evaluation of the efficiency of algorithms, time and space complexity
• Advanced algorithms such as brute-force greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming 

Problem 1:
Open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g, inputs, outputs, series of functions).

Problem 2:
Open-ended practice problems such as LRU Cache, Private Blockchain, File Recursion, and many more.

Problem 3:
real-world open-ended problems, such as request routing for a web server, search-term auto-completion and Fibonacci heap

Problem 4:
Route-planning algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map with the implementation of the A* algorithm to find shortest path.
