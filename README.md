Description of Problems
------------

**Problem 1:**
Deconstruction of a series of open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g, inputs, outputs, series of functions).

**Problem 2:**
Open-ended practice problems: LRU Cache, Private Blockchain, File Recursion.

**Problem 3:**
Real-world open-ended problems: request routing for a web server, search-term auto-completion and Fibonacci heap

**Problem 4:**
Route-planning algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map with the implementation of the A* algorithm to find shortest path.
