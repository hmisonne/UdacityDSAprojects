Student provides a file explaining their run time analysis (Worst Case Big O Notation) for each solution they produced.

Task0:
The run time is O(1). There is only 1 input data and no iterations are computed

Task1:
The run time is O(n). There are 2 loops that iterate over each line of the 2 dataset. These loops are consecutives, thus the input is 2n which becomes O(n)

Task2:
The run time is O(n). A first loop will iterate over each line of the call dataset to build a dictionnary with all numbers. Then another loop will iterate over each value of the dictionnary to find the number that spent the longest time on the phone 

Task3:
- Part A
The run time is O(n). A first loop will iterate over each line of the call dataset to get all receiver area codes based on the caller area code. Then to print the sorted area code I used another loop to go through the results and used the sorted function which should be O(n log n) which is less than O(n).
- Part B
The run time is O(n).There is one main loop with if statements.

Task4:
The run time is O(n). There are 3 main loops, they all traverse the database once which means O(3n) (which is equal to O(n) ). Then there is one loop to iterate over the results with a sorted function O(n log n) (see previous answer).
