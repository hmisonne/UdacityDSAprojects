Student provides a file explaining their run time analysis (Worst Case Big O Notation) for each solution they produced.

Task0:
The run time is O(1). There is only 1 input data and no iterations are computed

Task1:
The run time is O(n). There are 2 loops that iterate over each line of the 2 dataset. These loops are consecutives, thus the input is 2n which becomes O(n)

Task2:
The run time is O(n). A first loop will iterate over each line of the call dataset to build a dictionnary with all numbers. Then another loop will iterate over each value of the dictionnary to find the number that spent the longest time on the phone 

Task3:
The run time is O(n).

Task4:
The run time is O(n).
